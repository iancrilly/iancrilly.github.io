  <div class="question" id="question1">
    <h2>Does your panel have a 200A main breaker?</h2>
    <p>
      This is the largest breaker in your panel, both in size and on the number printed on it. 
      Usually, it will say 100A, 125A, 150A, or 200A. 
      <strong>The print on this breaker MUST be "200A" to continue.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below, there are two styles of main breakers outlined in yellow. 
      Notice how both are much larger than the rest. They also may have a sticker next to them labeled 
      "Service Disconnect," shown in our example outlined in purple.

  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <div class="question hidden" id="question2">
    <h2>Would your charger be mounted within 5' or 25' of your panel?</h2>
    <p>
      In the example below, the panel is outlined in yellow. 
      This is the same panel that your 200A main breaker is on in the previous step!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our measurements are all done along the wall. 
      So everything in the <strong>red zone</strong> in our example is within 5' of the panel. 
      Everything in the <strong>green zone</strong> is within 25' of the panel.
    </p>

      If you're unsure, just select "I'm Not Sure" and fill out our intake form. 
      Make sure to attach some photos of your panel and where you want your charger so we can get a quote to you!
